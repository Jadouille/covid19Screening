The idea is to create an app that would screen people who think they may have contracted covid-19.

The app would screen individuals by asking certain questions, and give recommendations on what their next steps are based on WHO protocols.

What differentiates this app from a normal screening protocol, would be the data science/machine learning element to it, which would give the individual a percent chance of infection based on past infection datasets and a personal profile which they would enter at the beginning.

Another optional addition would be to add in a choice at the very beginning whether it was being used for personal screening or business screening.  The business screening would allow for multiple predictions and keep this information in a database that would then allow for statistics at a certain location.  This could be useful for business that have multiple offices around the world to gauge how seriously the company is taking the covid-19 situation.
